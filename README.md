# Payanam AI: Intelligent Travel Agent
Making travel planning intelligent, simple, and delightful

## Background

Planning travel involves searching multiple platforms, comparing prices, and making decisions based on incomplete information. Payanam AI revolutionizes this experience by combining intelligent AI conversation with real-time travel data aggregation. Instead of visiting multiple websites, travelers can simply chat with an AI assistant that understands their needs and provides personalized flight and hotel recommendations in a clean, organized format.
